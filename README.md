# React Resume Builder

This project is a React-based resume builder application, converted from a basic HTML/CSS/JS template (available in the `/old_assets` directory). It provides a modern and interactive way to create and customize professional resumes, with data managed through a simple JSON file.

**Key Features:**

*   **React-Based:** Completely rewritten using React for a dynamic and interactive user experience.
*   **Editable Content:** All resume content is managed through a `content.json` file, making it easy to customize without touching the code.
*   **Form Validation:** Implemented client-side form validation to ensure data integrity.
*   **Google Sheets Integration:** Integrated with Google Sheets using Apps Script to store and potentially retrieve resume data. (Apps Script link: [Share your Apps Script file link here])
*   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for viewing on various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile).
*   **SEO Optimization:** Basic SEO tags added for improved search engine visibility.
*   **Title Scroll CSS:** Added a visually appealing scrolling effect to the title.
*   **Responsive Gravity Pills:** Implemented visually engaging "gravity pills" for interactive elements.

**Screenshots/Demo:**

*(Optional: Include screenshots or a link to a live demo if you have one deployed.)*

**Technologies Used:**

*   React
*   HTML
*   CSS

**Content Management:**

All resume data is stored in `content.json`. Simply edit this file to customize your resume content. The structure of the JSON should be self-explanatory, but feel free to open an issue if you have questions.

**Google Sheets Integration:**

This project uses Google Apps Script to interact with a Google Sheet. The Apps Script code is available here: [Share your Apps Script file link here]. You'll need to set up your own Google Sheet and configure the Apps Script to work with it. Instructions for this setup should be included in the Apps Script file or in a separate documentation file (recommended).

**Future Enhancements:**

*   **AI Integration:** Exploring the possibility of integrating AI features to enhance resume creation.
